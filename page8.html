      <div class="head"> One: Collect enough pop tabs</div>
      <div class="info">
        <p> Having enough pop tabs is a crucial part to this project being
          succesful. Collect about 1000. You will also need metal cutters, a
          staple remover, and an old key. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="head"> Two: Bending tabs</div>
      <div class="info">
        <p> Use the key to bend the inner part of the tab from the top side. Bend
        it all the way back so that the tab can lay flat on a surface. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="head"> Three: Cut the tab </div>
      <div class="info">
        <p> Cut the middle of the tab on all of the tab.  Make sure that you \
          cut the same place on each tab. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="head"> Four: Bending tabs </div>
      <div class="info">
        <p> Using the stapple remover, bend each tab by putting the cut side in
          first and close down. This will create a bend in the tab where the
           metal bridge is.  </p>
      </div>

      <div class="head">Five: Weaving tabs together</div>
      <div class="info">
          <img src="tab.jpg" class="video" width="650px" height="450px">
        <p>Push one of the tabs through the cut on another tab to create a link
          between them. After this, do the same thing on the opposite side.
          Connect the second and third tabs together by putting a tab through
           both of them. This will create a weave-like pattern. Keep doing this
         in a pattern until you get your desired look. </p>
