  <p>How to tie dye your own sweatshirt. </p>
  </div>

  <div class= "intructions">
    <div class= "head"> One: Pick a sweatshirt and tie it up </div>
    <div class= "info">
      <p> choose a sweatshirt that you would like to tie dye. Then, using
      rubberbands, tie up the sweatshirt by twisting it from the center.  The
       rubberbands can be used to section off the sweatshirt for different
       types of dye, but if you are only planning on using one color, the
       rubber bands are just to hold it together. </p>
       </div>

    <div class= "head"> Two: Start dying the sweatshirt </div>

    <p> Start pouring die onto shirt in a strategical or random way. If you do
      not have clothing dye, you can use bleach or toliet bowl cleaner (That is
       what i used).  Once you put the dye or bleach in all the desired places,
        let the shirt sit for about 20-30 minutes. </p>
        </div>

      <div class= "head"> Three: Rinse and Dry. </div>
      <div class= "info">
      <p> After the sweatshirt has set, run the sweatshirt under water and hang
         it up to dry.  This is so you can see if there are any changes you
         would like to make.  If not, throw the sweatshirt in the washer and
          dryer. Make sure to put it in its own seprate wash becuase the bleach
          may bleed onto other clothes during the first wash. </p>
          </div>
