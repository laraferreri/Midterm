  <div class ="head"> One: Choosing a color scheme </div>
  <p>First, choose a color scheme that you want to follow while creating the background.</p>

  <div class = "head"> Two: Find magazines and look through them </div>
  <div class= "info">
  <p> Next, gather up some magazines and use them to find images for the
    collage.  Try to pick things that stick out to you or that follow your color
    scheme. Once you find something that stands out, cut it out however you want.
     I suggest cutting some images into squares and some images against the
     border of the object to give the collage variety. </p>
     </div>

  <div class = "head"> Three: Creating collage </div>
  <div class= "info">
  <p> Using the collection of images you cut from the magazine, lay out all of
     the clippings in a way that makes sense to you.  Once you have a layout
     you are happy with, use glue to paste the magazine clippings onto a thick
     piece of paper. Make sure you use something thick enough to handle the
     glue. Wait for it to dry </p>
     </div>

  <div class ="head"> Four: taking a picture </div>
  <div class= "info">
  <p> After the glue has dred, the collage is finshed.  Now, take a picture of
    the collage.  You can crop and edit the photo to your liking, and set that
    picture as your background. </p>
